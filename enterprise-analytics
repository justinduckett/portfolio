## Enterprise analytics: Tracking Full User Journeys & Optimizing Conversions

### Summary:

I led an enterprise initiative to implement a unified analytics system across all public facing Ontario.ca services, establishing a single, secure view of the end-to-end user journey. This involved configuring advanced cross-domain tracking, implementing GTM, and authoring a 67-page Data Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to standardize compliance. The platform now delivers deep insights into user movements and service drop-off points, standardizing data for product teams and executives.

### Tools used:

- **Google Tag Manager (GTM)** – Enterprise-level container ownership and configuration
- **Google Analytics 4** – Destination platform for consolidated web and product data
- **Data Layer** – Standardized data model used for tagging and data transmission
- **Data Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** – Comprehensive governance documentation and standardized privacy protocol
- **Looker Studio** – For data visualization and reporting on end-to-end user flows
- **HTML, JavaScript, and CSS** – For data layer manipulation and site tag implementation

### Purpose of the work:

The goal was to **eliminate data fragmentation** and provide actionable, end-to-end user journey insights across government services. While the user views Ontario.ca and related services as a single entity, the underlying technology stack and governance structure resulted in siloed analytics.

This project achieved:

- **Improved service delivery** by measuring macro-level performance metrics, such as completion rates.
- **Accurate ROI measurement** for digital marketing by tracking users from the Ontario.ca landing page through to transaction completion.
- **Standardization of data, privacy, and security** practices, mitigating the risk of sensitive PII collection.
- **Reduced duplication of effort** by centralizing skill sets and providing a compliant analytics framework.

### Key project phases:

**1. Governance and Privacy Standardization**
   
I authored and secured approval for the 67-page PIA, which standardized rules for cross-domain tracking and data collection. This centralized approach drastically reduced the compliance burden on product teams, ensuring all data collection was secure and privacy-focused.

**2. Data Visualization and Reporting Framework**

Looker Studio was linked to the Google Sheet to visualize metrics through charts, scorecards, and trend lines. By maintaining a consistent data schema, I could refresh the visuals each month without needing to rebuild the dashboard.

**3. Written Insights and Storytelling**

I authored the narrative content directly in Looker Studio, combining visual data with written analysis to explain trends, seasonal shifts, or the impact of major announcements and campaigns.

**4. Key Report Features**

- **New & Notable Page:** Highlights a new feature or service launched on Ontario.ca each month. This section showcases impact, user adoption, and next steps — helping raise visibility for the Digital and Data team’s work across government.
- **Trending Pages Analysis:** Displays which Ontario.ca pages are rising or falling in popularity compared to the previous month. Insights often tie to current events, seasonal demand, or active marketing campaigns, developed through collaboration with product and communications teams.

### Results and impact

This project modernized how executive stakeholders consume digital performance insights. It helped ensure that data-informed storytelling became a regular part of strategic discussions and decision-making.

Key outcomes include:
- **16 hour reduction** in manual data preparation time each month
- **60% improvement** in data accuracy and reporting consistency
- Enhanced awareness across senior leadership of key public interests and digital priorities
- Regular positive feedback from managers on the “New & Notable” section for effectively showcasing team impact

Overall, the report has become a trusted and anticipated deliverable each month. One that blends **technical automation, data visualization, and strategic communication** to tell the story of how Ontarians interact with government online.
