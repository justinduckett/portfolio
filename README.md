## Projects
### Alcoholic beverage map

During an LCBO strike in July 2024, the Ontario government rolled out a searchable and interactive map to help consumers find outlets to buy beer, wine, cider and spirits. For this project I was responsible for geocoding over 6,000 address locations for the map, as well as setting up web analytics and reporting.
